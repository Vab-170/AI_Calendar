/**
 * EVENTS API ROUTE - Event Storage & Retrieval System
 * 
 * This file handles all event-related database operations for the AI Calendar.
 * It provides a simple REST API for storing and retrieving calendar events.
 * 
 * Current Implementation: In-memory storage (temporary)
 * Production Ready: Can be easily replaced with database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
 * 
 * API Endpoints:
 * - GET /api/events  : Retrieve all stored events
 * - POST /api/events : Store a new event
 */

/**
 * TEMPORARY EVENT STORAGE
 * 
 * In-memory array to store events during development.
 * 
 * Why in-memory for now?
 * - Quick setup for development and testing
 * - No database configuration needed
 * - Easy to understand and debug
 * 
 * Production Considerations:
 * - Data is lost when server restarts
 * - Not suitable for multiple users
 * - Should be replaced with persistent database
 * 
 * Future Database Options:
 * - MongoDB: Good for flexible event schemas
 * - PostgreSQL: Excellent for structured data with relationships
 * - Supabase: Easy setup with real-time features
 * - PlanetScale: Serverless MySQL with excellent scaling

/**
 * GET REQUEST HANDLER - Retrieve All Events
 * 
 * Endpoint: GET /api/events
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - Fetches all stored events from memory/database
 * - Used by the calendar component to display events
 * - Returns events in JSON format for frontend consumption
 * 
 * Response Format:
 * [
 *   {
 *     title: "Math Lecture",
 *     start: "2025-07-29T09:00:00Z",
 *     end: "2025-07-29T10:00:00Z",
 *     eventType: "lecture",
 *     color: "#3B82F6",
 *     description: "Advanced Mathematics"
 *   },
 *   ...more events
 * ]
 * 
 * Usage by Frontend:
 * - Calendar component calls this on page load
 * - Updates calendar display with all events
 * - Enables filtering and event statistics

/**
 * POST REQUEST HANDLER - Store New Event
 * 
 * Endpoint: POST /api/events
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - Receives new event data from OpenAI API route
 * - Processes and stores the event in memory/database
 * - Converts date strings to proper Date objects
 * - Returns success confirmation
 * 
 * Request Body Format:
 * {
 *   title: "Physics Lab",
 *   start: "2025-07-30T14:00:00Z",    // ISO date string
 *   end: "2025-07-30T17:00:00Z",      // ISO date string
 *   eventType: "tutorial",
 *   color: "#10B981",
 *   description: "Lab work on mechanics"
 * }
 * 
 * Data Processing:
 * 1. Extract event data from request body
 * 2. Convert ISO date strings to JavaScript Date objects
 * 3. Add processed event to storage array
 * 4. Return success status
 * 
 * Date Conversion Importance:
 * - Frontend sends dates as ISO strings
 * - Calendar component expects Date objects
 * - Ensures proper date handling and display
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Could be enhanced with validation
 * - Should check for required fields
 * - Could validate date formats
 */
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {

  // Convert ISO date strings to Date objects for proper calendar handling
  // This ensures the calendar component can correctly process and display dates

    ...data, 
    start: new Date(data.start), 
    end: new Date(data.end) 
  });

}

/**
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS FOR PRODUCTION:
 * 
 * 1. Database Integration:
 *    - Replace EVENTS array with database calls
 *    - Add proper connection handling
 *    - Implement connection pooling
 * 
 * 2. Data Validation:
 *    - Validate required fields (title, start, end)
 *    - Check date format validity
 *    - Ensure eventType is valid
 * 
 * 3. Error Handling:
 *    - Try-catch blocks for database operations
 *    - Proper HTTP status codes
 *    - Detailed error messages
 * 
 * 4. Additional Endpoints:
 *    - PUT /api/events/:id  (Update event)
 *    - DELETE /api/events/:id  (Delete event)
 *    - GET /api/events/:id  (Get single event)
 * 
 * 5. Filtering & Pagination:
 *    - Query parameters for date ranges
 *    - Event type filtering
 *    - Pagination for large datasets
 * 
 * 6. User Management:
 *    - Associate events with user IDs
 *    - Authentication middleware
 *    - User-specific event retrieval
 * 
 * 7. Real-time Updates:
 *    - WebSocket support for live updates
 *    - Event notifications
 *    - Collaborative calendar features
